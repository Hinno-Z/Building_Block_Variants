# Building_Block_Variants
Craft stairs, slabs, and walls from all colors of concrete and terracotta. (Plans to add glass as well)

This mod adds the desired building block variants of concrete and terracotta blocks without any fluff or fuss. 
Variants are craftable both in crafting tables and stonecutters.


--I know there's like 500 mods that create these blocks, but I'm new to modding and am using basic ideas like this to practice!--
